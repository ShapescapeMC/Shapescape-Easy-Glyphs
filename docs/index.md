# Shapescape Easy Glyphs
Shapescape Easy Glyphs is a Regolith filter that makes adding custom glyphs easier. 

## 🧑‍🏫 About
The filter allows you to group glyphs into categories, making it easier to add new glyphs without disrupting the positions of existing ones. Categories are defined by the folder structure, and each category is processed sequentially. The filter ensures that enough space is left between categories for future additions, and it generates a JSON file containing Unicode mappings for all glyphs.
